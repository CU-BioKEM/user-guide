Using software
==============

The Blanca cluster is managed by a `SLURM <https://slurm.schedmd.com>`__ system, which queues jobs from all users 
and runs them when resources become available. There are two ways to run software on the cluster:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   using_software/sbatch
   using_software/interactive

For various reasons, submitting an ``sbatch`` script is the preferred method.  

Using specific programs on Blanca:

.. toctree::
