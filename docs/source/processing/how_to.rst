How to use blanca-biokem
========================

Getting started
---------------
In order to run software on BioKEM's Blanca servers:
   - Request access to Blanca through `Research Computing <https://rcamp.rc.colorado.edu/accounts/account-request/create/organization>`_
   - Request a Petalibrary allocation (~20TB/active project) by emailing rc-help@colorado.edu **Make sure to have them create a 'biokem-deposit' folder for your lab to deposit Krios images into**
   - Purchase an SBGrid license for your lab

     - Labs without an SBgrid license will have minimal access to software.
     - Labs with their own SBgrid license will be able to access the full stack of software, without limitation.
