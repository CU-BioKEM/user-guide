Getting started
===============

In order to run software on BioKEM's Blanca servers:
   #. Request a Research Computing account with access to Blanca through `Research Computing <https://rcamp.rc.colorado.edu/accounts/account-request/create/organization>`_
   #. Set up a Petalibrary allocation (~20TB/active project) by emailing rc-help@colorado.edu **Make sure to have them create a 'biokem-deposit' folder for your lab to deposit Krios images into**
   #. Purchase an SBGrid license for your lab

      - Labs without an SBGrid license will have minimal access to software.
      - Labs with their own SBGrid license will be able to access the full stack of software, without limitation.

   #. In order to be given access to BioKEM owned nodes and software, you must complete three training courses provided by CURC (check scheduling here: `CURC Events and Training <https://www.colorado.edu/rc/events>`_):

       - RC New User Seminar 
       - Super Computing Spin Up: Part 1 - Working with Linux
       - Super Computing Spin Up: Part 2 â€“ Job Scheduling 
 
   #. Send reciept of completion of the three RC courses above to the BioKEM cluster administrator (`shla9937@colorado.edu`_) to be added to the BioKEM parition. 
   #. Start running jobs as outlined here (insert link)
