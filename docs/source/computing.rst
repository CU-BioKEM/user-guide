Computing on blanca-biokem
==========================

The BioKEM computing environment consists of three main parts: Petalibrary, 
Blanca, and SBGrid. In order to use the cluster, you will need to gain access to 
all three of these resources (see :doc:`computing/general_users`). In brief, you will
host your dataset on Petalibrary, process it on nodes within the Blanca 
computing cluster using software managed through SBGrid.
