Computing on blanca-biokem
==========================

The BioKEM computing server consists of three main parts: Petalibrary, Blanca,
and SBGrid. In order to use the server, you will need to gain access to all
three of these resources. Information on how to do this can be found in the
Getting started section. In brief, you will host your dataset on Petalibrary,
process it on GPUs within the Blanca computing cluster using software managed
through SBGrid.
