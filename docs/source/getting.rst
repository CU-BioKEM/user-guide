Getting your data
=================

Push to Petalibrary **Preferred**
---------------------------------
The preferred method of getting your data from the BioKEM facility is to have us push
it to your `biokem-deposit` folder. We can do this in real time so you can start 
processing data as it comes off the scope (we can also do 
:doc:/computing/otf_motion_correction for you). You can also push your data 
Petalibrary from :ref:`Interm storage` once Chuck has set you up with a user profile 
on the biokem-storage server.
