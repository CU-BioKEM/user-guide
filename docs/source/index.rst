Welcome to BioKEM's documentation!
=======================================
The University of Colorado Boulder Biochemistry Department's Krios Electron 
Microscopy facility (BioKEM) offers single particle cryo-EM and cryo-ET of plunge-frozen samples. Using a Titan Krios G3i (funded by HHMI) 
for high resolution data collection on a Gatan K3 Direct Detection Camera the 
BioKEM facility is able to offer high-end data collection at atomic level 
resolution with an option to have on the fly motion correction, particle 
picking, and 2D class averaging. The BioKEM facility uses Serial EM for SPA 
and cryo-ET data acquisition. For sample prep and vitrification please 
contact CU Boulder's Electron Microscopy Services at the Moleclular Cellular 
Developmental Biology Department.
